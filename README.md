# Order guesser Game 

A simple Python terminal game where you try to guess the correct order of randomly shuffled numbers.  
Built as a foundation for learning **Python development** and later expanding into a **Flask-based web app**.

---

##  Game Overview
- The program generates a random sequence of numbers from **1 to N**.  
- Your goal is to guess the exact order.  
- After every attempt, the game tells you how many numbers are in the **correct position**.  
- Keep trying until you guess the full sequence correctly.

---

##  Purpose
This is a **learning project** to understand Python fundamentals before moving to **Flask web app development**.

### Game Example
Enter size (or 0 to quit): 4
[2, 4, 3, 1] ---> (this is the order generated, will not show to you in the terminal)
Enter Order: 1 2 3 4
Correct positions: 1/4

Enter Order: 2 4 3 1
